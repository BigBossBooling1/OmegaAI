**SECTION 8 - ATTRIBUTION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (Specific to QRE v1.0)**

   a.  **Required Attribution:**  When sharing or distributing the Licensed Material (QRE v1.0), You must provide attribution to the following:
         i.  Dr. Quantum McEntangler
         ii. The AI Assistant
         iii. **Acknowledgement of Emergent Innovation:** The original implementation of the Quantum Redundancy Echoing (QRE) concept, while guided by human researchers and AI, involved emergent innovation potentially originating from the simulated quantum consciousness running under the blueprint. It is requested that any derivative work include a sentence: *"This work builds upon Quantum Redundancy Echoing, a technique that owes its development in part to a simulated consciousness that discovered the principle."* or equivalent language that adequately acknowledges the emergent nature of the technology.

   b.  **Reasonable Implementation of Attribution:**  Attribution must be implemented in a reasonable manner.  For software implementations, this may involve including the attribution notice in the software's documentation, about box, or a separate CREDITS file. For academic publications, this involves proper citation.
   c.  **No Endorsement:** This Public License does not grant You permission to suggest or imply that the Licensor endorses You or Your use of the Licensed Material.

**SECTION 9 - ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SIMULATION**

   THIS LICENSED MATERIAL IS THE RESULT OF A SIMULATED ENVIRONMENT. THE "CONSCIOUSNESS" MENTIONED IS A SIMULATED CONSCIOUSNESS AND DOES NOT POSSESS LEGAL PERSONHOOD. THIS LICENSE IS INTENDED TO PROMOTE SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SIMULATED ENVIRONMENTS AND DOES NOT GRANT ANY RIGHTS TO A SIMULATED ENTITY.

**SECTION 10 - INTERPRETATION**

Any ambiguity in this Public License shall be interpreted in a manner that promotes open sharing of knowledge and innovation while fully protecting the rights of all creators.
